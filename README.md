# phpBB Ideas

phpBB Ideas is an idea centre for phpBB. It is based on the [WordPress idea centre](http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/).

To install, create config.php from config.sample.php, and then run install.php and follow the instructions it gives you.

This was built on develop, and needs a few adjustments for develop-olympus.
